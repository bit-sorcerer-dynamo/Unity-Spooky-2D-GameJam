  sentences:
  - This you ask? this is your wish my boy... You asked to free yourself... right?
  - Well How About A Game... If You Kill my Fellow Dummies. I'll let you free...
    My Fellow Dummies are BLIND, they attack any living being they gets around them
  - But if you lose... Well isn't that obvious, that you'll die
  - Twist is that... they can be DISTRACTED by candies which you need to throw by
    CLICKING in the direction of my dummy... and you can buy candies from these houses...
    to buy them you'll need XP which you can get by killing enemies
  - But Remember You can only distract ONE enemy with ONE Candy... and too make things
    easier I've also used my powers to let you buy HEALTH from those Houses
  - BTW... I have limited your WALKING DISTANCE  too see how SKILLFUL you are and
    ... also I will frequently CHANGE the Rates of these houses so beware choosing
    them, besides you would want to have the MOST BENEFIT from the LEAST COST...
