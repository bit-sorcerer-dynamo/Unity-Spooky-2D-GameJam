  sentences:
  - This you ask? this is your wish my boy... You asked to free yourself... right?
  - Well How About A Game... If You Kill my Fellow Dummies. I'll let you free...
    My Fellow Dummies are blind, they Attack any living being they gets around them
  - But if you lose... Well isn't that obvious, that you'll die
  - To Win The Game, Kill My Enemies By Clashing them towards each other... They
    get Distracted by the Candies...
  - You can Throw the candies by clicking them in the direction of Dummies... and
    You can Purchase them in the stores you see here... You'll also see Health as
    an Alternative to Candies
  - BTW... I'd be performing some rituals, to change the Rates of these stores...
    this would make the game fun ( deep laugh XD )
  - You'll notice the rituals once wolfs howl...
